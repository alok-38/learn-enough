    <h2>what is front-end development?</h2>
    <p>When someone says that they are a front-end developer, that means that they work on the parts of a site that people see and interact with. That includes things like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll also hear people talk about user interface (UI) design (the way things look) and user experience (UX) design (the way that the interface and different pages function to move users through the site to a goal).</p>

    <p>We'll start by building on the styling introduced in <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html">Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</a>. In the final sections of that tutorial, we showed how to add styling directly to elements on a page, while also briefly covering how to factor that styling into a stylesheet. In this tutorial, we'll expand greatly on this theme.</p>
