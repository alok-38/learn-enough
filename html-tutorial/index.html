                Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
                technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
                command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
                everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
                Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
                We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
                learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

                I am a string about things. Some of those things are more important than others,
                and I want to draw attention to them, so I will <strong>make them
                strong</strong> so that they stand out among their less spectacular neighbors.
